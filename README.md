# shiny-pagespeed-graphing
This graphs the metrics from google's pagespeed analytics which have been saved every few minutes for several weeks 
at a time. 
The user can choose a number of days back to graph. The information being graphed in the density graphs are the bounce
 rates for users and user activity. The lower graphs show how many resources make up the page itself - js, css, html files and the like.
